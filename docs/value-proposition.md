## Value Proposition 
Our app offers fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious eaters access to a social media-like recipe platform with filter functions for Kcal and Macros, 
as well as an optional tracking feature to track progress. As a result, "Calorie Crave" is also the ideal app for Steffen, 
who wants to eat healthy and build muscle without investing a lot of time and effort alongside his studies and job as a waiter. 
With the "For You" page and the filter function, he can quickly and easily search for dishes that meet his calorie and macronutrient 
needs and help him reach his goals. Steffen can choose from a variety of dishes posted by different users with varying levels of experience. 
The simple and clear presentation of the nutritional information in combination with the recipes makes it easier for him to implement a healthy diet 
and helps him achieve his goals. In addition, Steffen can save his favorites and create lists for bulk or diet phases to optimize his diet. 
The tracking function allows him to track his progress and make targeted adjustments to his diet. By using the "CalorieCrave" app, 
 teffen can save time and find healthy dishes for his everyday life without much creative effort to effectively reach his goals.


## Goals And Ambitions
Together as a group, our goal is to implement all the core features of the app while also designing the UI to meet our requirements.
We also want to meet the requirements of the course and learn as much as possible.
We want to consolidate the workflow with Git and other important elements in development, so that we are also better prepared for practice.
So we try to implement the app so far that we could also use it ourselves in everyday life.
