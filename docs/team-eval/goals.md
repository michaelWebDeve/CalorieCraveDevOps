Throughout the development process, our collaborative efforts have resulted in the creation of a functional and 
user-friendly recipe-sharing app. As a team, we have made major design decisions both on the frontend and backend, 
which have greatly contributed to the app's overall look and functionality. The decision to implement a scrollable homepage 
with filter and reset buttons has enhanced the user experience, allowing for efficient navigation and recipe discovery.
Collectively, we have aimed to integrate these features, ensuring that users can easily engage with the app's 
functionalities. The app's design, with the scrollable home page being our main feature, in line with our initial ideation,
have been realized effectively.
Our collaborative approach, emphasis on Git workflow, and dedication to meeting course requirements have contributed to 
our app's success. We believe that the skills and insights gained from this project will greatly benefit us in future projects. 
This app, which we've built to meet our own requirements, showcases our commitment to practical development and learning, 
and we are proud to have achieved all of our set goals in the process.
