## [Justin Gr√ºnberg] - review 2

## My observation
I've noticed that when we encountered unexpected challenges, you were always very actively interested in finding solutions and discussing them with the team. You were always willing to use our regular team meetings to talk about these challenges and collectively consider the best approaches to take.

## Effect on me
Your proactive attitude and commitment to teamwork have given me a sense of confidence that we can handle even tough problems as a team. It has motivated me to share my thoughts and ideas more openly with the team and to engage more actively.

## Tip for the future
Please keep it up. Your open and proactive communication was a significant contribution to effective teamwork and had helped us to achieve better results together. I would appreciate it if you could continue this practice and perhaps even bring in more suggestions and ideas for future projects.
