Reflecting on our backend design decisions, we recognize that opting for plain SQL instead of SQLAlchemy 
would have been a more favorable choice. While SQLAlchemy provided certain conveniences, such as abstracting database
interactions, we encountered complexities and a learning curve that proved time-consuming. The process of grasping the 
underlying concepts and effectively implementing them took longer than anticipated.
With a preference for plain SQL, we believe that we could have achieved a simpler and more efficient backend design. 
This approach would have allowed us to have a deeper understanding of the database interactions and the underlying 
structure.
In future projects, we would prioritize thoroughly evaluating the pros and cons of different technologies before making 
a decision. This experience has underscored the importance of considering the learning curve, potential complexities, 
and alignment with project goals.
